Introduction:

    1. As a first Python environment and interpreter I would suggest to use https://repl.it/. 
       Python version 3.8

       We could prepare some commented code first to facilitate learning for our audience 

       I like movies so as a presentation what Pythoni is and what we can do with this language I
       would write some basic web scrapper (Selenium) and show our students some effective
       show.

       There is no other way to learn programming than by programming itself, so we should choose
       some very easy Python project to realize, but it depends of the duration of the lessons so
       please provide me some feedback about this topic.
       
       The project in repl.it should consist some commented code to go step by step with our users
       and show them how Python works, for example:

Basics:

    1. Introduction to variables 
    2. Basic mathematical operations
